1. Write a smart contract which stores a counter value in global state of the contract

   Version 1
    - Define a counter (Uint64) variable in global state
    - Initialize counter variable with 0 in _init_ method
    - define a method named increment which will increment the counter variable
    - define a method named decrement which will decrement the counter variable

   Version 2
    - Implement the above contract functionalities using local state instead of Global state
    - This contract will have user specific counters instead of single counter defined in Global state
